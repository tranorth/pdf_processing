determined by multiplying the asking gross lease rate for each building by\\nits available space, summing the products, then dividing by the sum of the available space with net leases for all\\nbuildings in the summary. GROSS LEASES: Includes all lease types whereby the tenant pays an agreed rent plus\\nestimated average monthly costs of the operating expenses and taxes for the property, including utilities, insurance\\nand/or maintenance expenses.NET ABSORPTION: The change in occupied sq. ft. from one period to the next, as\\nmeasured by available sq. ft. NET RENTABLE AREA: The gross building square footage minus the elevator core,\\nflues, pipe shafts, vertical ducts, balconies and stairwell areas. OCCUPIED AREA (SQ. FT.): Building area not\\nconsidered vacant. UNDER CONSTRUCTION: Buildings that have begun construction as evidenced by site\\nexcavation or foundation work. AVAILABLE AREA (SQ. FT.): Available building area that is either physically vacant\\nor occupied. AVAILABILITY RATE: Available sq. ft. divided by the net rentable area. VACANT AREA (SQ. FT.):\\nExisting building area that is physically vacant or immediately available. VACANCY RATE: Vacant building feet\\ndivided by the net rentable area. NORMALIZATION: Due to a reclassification of the market, the base, number and\\nsquare footage of buildings of previous quarters have been adjusted to match the current base. Availability and\\nvacancy figures for those buildings have been adjusted in previous quarters.\\nSurvey Criteria\\nIncludes all competitive buildings in CBRE’s survey set for the Downtown Boston Office and Lab Markets.\\nContact\\nSuzanne Duca Jacqueline Smith CBRE Offices\\nDirector of Research, New England Senior Research Analyst, New England 33 Arch Street, 28th Floor\\nsuzanne.duca@cbre.com jacqueline.smith1@cbre.com Boston, MA 02110\",\\r\\n\"© Copyright 2025 All rights reserved.

GROSS LEASES: Includes all lease types whereby the tenant pays an agreed rent plus\\\\nestimated average monthly costs of the operating expenses and taxes for the property, including utilities, insurance\\\\nand/or maintenance expenses.NET ABSORPTION: The change in occupied sq. ft. from one period to the next, as\\\\nmeasured by available sq. ft. NET RENTABLE AREA: The gross building square footage minus the elevator core,\\\\nflues, pipe shafts, vertical ducts, balconies and stairwell areas. OCCUPIED AREA (SQ. FT.): Building area not\\\\nconsidered vacant. UNDER CONSTRUCTION: Buildings that have begun construction as evidenced by site\\\\nexcavation or foundation work. AVAILABLE AREA (SQ. FT.): Available building area that is either physically vacant\\\\nor occupied. AVAILABILITY RATE: Available sq. ft. divided by the net rentable area. VACANT AREA (SQ. FT.):\\\\nExisting building area that is physically vacant or immediately available. VACANCY RATE: Vacant building feet\\\\ndivided by the net rentable area.

But by the top of Q3 2025, both the trade war rhetoric and effective tariff rate have softened.\\nWhile consumer and business sentiment surveys remain weak, the hard economic data (e.g., jobless claims,\\nCPI, orders) points to a more steady economy. To be sure, it could take time for the costs associated with\\nhigher tariffs and global uncertainty to filter through, but in the meantime CBRE has increased its 2025 GDP\\ngrowth outlook to 1.3% for 2025. Barring further disruptions this provides upside risk for hiring in coming\\nquarters.\\nCommercial real estate markets are taking these changes in stride. On the occupier side, continued growth\\ntranslates into positive absorption for many sectors and markets, including offices. Regarding capital\\nmarkets, investment volume is on track to exceed 2023 and 2024 levels. This is supported by credit\\nissuance making a turnaround and credit spreads falling back to pre-April 2 levels.\\nContacts\\nErik Rodriguez Marc L.

Q2\\\\n2025 began with the Liberation Day tariffs and subsequent escalation that caused growth expectations to\\\\nplummet. But by the top of Q3 2025, both the trade war rhetoric and effective tariff rate have softened.\\\\nWhile consumer and business sentiment surveys remain weak, the hard economic data (e.g., jobless claims,\\\\nCPI, orders) points to a more steady economy. To be sure, it could take time for the costs associated with\\\\nhigher tariffs and global uncertainty to filter through, but in the meantime CBRE has increased its 2025 GDP\\\\ngrowth outlook to 1.3% for 2025. Barring further disruptions this provides upside risk for hiring in coming\\\\nquarters.\\\\nCommercial real estate markets are taking these changes in stride. On the occupier side, continued growth\\\\ntranslates into positive absorption for many sectors and markets, including offices. Regarding capital\\\\nmarkets, investment volume is on track to exceed 2023 and 2024 levels. This is supported by credit\\\\nissuance making a turnaround and credit spreads falling back to pre-April 2 levels.\\\\nContacts\\\\nErik Rodriguez Marc L.

In addition to creating regional consistency, this change will enhance the reporting and depth of data on\\neach market\\'s most competitive buildings. Historical stats have been revised to reflect current industrial thresholds. Building\\ninventories will be evaluated quarterly to ensure they remain the most comprehensive and accurate representation of each market.\\nContacts\\nMaggie Parra Paul Van Devender Ashley Pifer\\nResearch Manager Managing Director Research Data Analyst\\nCBRE | North Midwest CBRE | Michigan CBRE | Midwest Research\\nmaggie.parra@cbre.com paul.vandevender@cbre.com ashley.pifer@cbre.com\\n©© 22002245 CCBBRREE,, IInncc..

In addition to creating regional consistency, this change will enhance the reporting and depth of data on\\\\neach market\\'s most competitive buildings. Historical stats have been revised to reflect current industrial thresholds. Building\\\\ninventories will be evaluated quarterly to ensure they remain the most comprehensive and accurate representation of each market.\\\\nContacts\\\\nMaggie Parra Paul Van Devender Ashley Pifer\\\\nResearch Manager Managing Director Research Data Analyst\\\\nCBRE | North Midwest CBRE | Michigan CBRE | Midwest Research\\\\nmaggie.parra@cbre.com paul.vandevender@cbre.com ashley.pifer@cbre.com\\\\n©© 22002245 CCBBRREE,, IInncc..

Buildings under construction\\nincludes buildings which have begun development beyond initial site work.\\nUpdated Tracked Criteria\\nCBRE has updated the criteria for industrial tracked building sets to reflect buildings with a Net Rentable Area (NRA) of\\n30,000 square feet or higher. In addition to creating regional consistency, this change will enhance the reporting and\\ndepth of data on each market\\'s most competitive buildings.

Average Asking Lease Rate: A calculated average that includes net and gross\\\\nlease rate, weighted by their corresponding available square footage. Building Area: The total floor area sq. ft. of the building,\\\\ntypically taken at the “drip line” of the building. Gross Activity: All sale and lease transactions completed within a specified time\\\\nperiod. Excludes investment sale transactions. Gross Lease Rate: Rent typically includes real property taxes, building insurance,\\\\nand major maintenance. Net Absorption: The change in Occupied Sq. Ft. from one period to the next. Net Lease Rate: Rent\\\\nexcludes one or more of the ”net” costs (real property taxes, building insurance, and major maintenance) typically included in a\\\\nGross Lease Rate. Occupied Sq. Ft.: Building Area not considered vacant. Vacancy Rate: Total Vacant Sq. Ft. divided by the total\\\\nBuilding Area. Vacant Sq. Ft.: Space that can be occupied within 30 days. Class A industrial are buildings built after 2000, with 32’\\\\nor greater clear height and ESFR sprinklers.\\\\nSurvey Criteria\\\\nIncludes all competitive industrial buildings 30,000 sq. ft. and greater in size in Johnson County (KS), Wyandotte County\\\\n(KS), Platte County (MO), Clay County (MO), Jackson County (MO), and Cass County (MO). Buildings under construction\\\\nincludes buildings which have begun development beyond initial site work.\\\\nUpdated Tracked Criteria\\\\nCBRE has updated the criteria for industrial tracked building sets to reflect buildings with a Net Rentable Area (NRA) of\\\\n30,000 square feet or higher. In addition to creating regional consistency, this change will enhance the reporting and\\\\ndepth of data on each market\\'s most competitive buildings. Historical stats have been revised to reflect current industrial\\\\nthresholds. Building inventories will be evaluated quarterly to ensure they remain the most comprehensive and accurate\\\\nrepresentation of each market.\\\\nContacts\\\\nDavid Ronsick\\\\nSenior Research Analyst\\\\n+1 816 968 5879\\\\ndavid.ronsick@cbre.com\\\\n©© 22002245 CCBBRREE,, IInncc..

But by the top of Q3 2025, both the trade war rhetoric and effective tariff rate have softened.\\nWhile consumer and business sentiment surveys remain weak, the hard economic data (e.g., jobless claims,\\nCPI, orders) points to a more steady economy. To be sure, it could take time for the costs associated with\\nhigher tariffs and global uncertainty to filter through, but in the meantime CBRE has increased its 2025 GDP\\ngrowth outlook to 1.3% for 2025. Barring further disruptions this provides upside risk for hiring in coming\\nquarters.\\nCommercial real estate markets are taking these changes in stride. On the occupier side, continued growth\\ntranslates into positive absorption for many sectors and markets, including offices. Regarding capital\\nmarkets, investment volume is on track to exceed 2023 and 2024 levels. This is supported by credit\\nissuance making a turnaround and credit spreads falling back to pre-April 2 levels.\\nContacts\\nErik Rodriguez Marc L.

Average Asking Lease Rate: A calculated average that includes net and gross\\\\nlease rate, weighted by their corresponding available square footage. Building Area: The total floor area sq. ft. of the building,\\\\ntypically taken at the “drip line” of the building. Gross Activity: All sale and lease transactions completed within a specified time\\\\nperiod. Excludes investment sale transactions. Gross Lease Rate: Rent typically includes real property taxes, building insurance,\\\\nand major maintenance. Net Absorption: The change in Occupied Sq. Ft. from one period to the next. Net Lease Rate: Rent\\\\nexcludes one or more of the ”net” costs (real property taxes, building insurance, and major maintenance) typically included in a\\\\nGross Lease Rate. Occupied Sq. Ft.: Building Area not considered vacant. Vacancy Rate: Total Vacant Sq. Ft. divided by the total\\\\nBuilding Area. Vacant Sq. Ft.: Space that can be occupied within 30 days. Class A industrial are buildings built after 2000, with 32’\\\\nor greater clear height and ESFR sprinklers.\\\\nSurvey Criteria\\\\nIncludes all competitive industrial buildings 30,000 sq. ft. and greater in size in Johnson County (KS), Wyandotte County\\\\n(KS), Platte County (MO), Clay County (MO), Jackson County (MO), and Cass County (MO). Buildings under construction\\\\nincludes buildings which have begun development beyond initial site work.\\\\nUpdated Tracked Criteria\\\\nCBRE has updated the criteria for industrial tracked building sets to reflect buildings with a Net Rentable Area (NRA) of\\\\n30,000 square feet or higher. In addition to creating regional consistency, this change will enhance the reporting and\\\\ndepth of data on each market\\'s most competitive buildings. Historical stats have been revised to reflect current industrial\\\\nthresholds. Building inventories will be evaluated quarterly to ensure they remain the most comprehensive and accurate\\\\nrepresentation of each market.\\\\nContacts\\\\nDavid Ronsick\\\\nSenior Research Analyst\\\\n+1 816 968 5879\\\\ndavid.ronsick@cbre.com\\\\n©© 22002245 CCBBRREE,, IInncc..

Q2\\n2025 began with the Liberation Day tariffs and subsequent escalation that caused growth expectations to\\nplummet. But by the top of Q3 2025, both the trade war rhetoric and effective tariff rate have softened.\\nWhile consumer and business sentiment surveys remain weak, the hard economic data (e.g., jobless claims,\\nCPI, orders) points to a more steady economy. To be sure, it could take time for the costs associated with\\nhigher tariffs and global uncertainty to filter through, but in the meantime CBRE has increased its 2025 GDP\\ngrowth outlook to 1.3% for 2025. Barring further disruptions this provides upside risk for hiring in coming\\nquarters.\\nCommercial real estate markets are taking these changes in stride. On the occupier side, continued growth\\ntranslates into positive absorption for many sectors and markets, including offices. Regarding capital\\nmarkets, investment volume is on track to exceed 2023 and 2024 levels. This is supported by credit\\nissuance making a turnaround and credit spreads falling back to pre-April 2 levels.\\nContacts\\nErik Rodriguez Marc L.

Ft.: Space in a building, ready for occupancy within six months; can be occupied or vacant. Availability Rate: Total Available Sq. Ft. divided by the\\ntotal building Area. Average Asking Lease Rate: A calculated average that includes net and gross lease rate, weighted by their corresponding available square\\nfootage. Building Area: The total floor area sq. ft. of the building, typically taken at the “drip line” of the building. Gross Activity: All sale and lease transactions\\ncompleted within a specified time period. Excludes investment sale transactions. Gross Lease Rate: Rent typically includes real property taxes, building\\ninsurance, and major maintenance. Net Absorption: The change in Occupied Sq. Ft. from one period to the next. Net Lease Rate: Rent excludes one or more of\\nthe ”net” costs (real property taxes, building insurance, and major maintenance) typically included in a Gross Lease Rate. Occupied Sq. Ft.: Building Area not\\nconsidered vacant. Vacancy Rate: Total Vacant Sq. Ft. divided by the total Building Area. Vacant Sq. Ft.: Space that can be occupied within 30 days. Class A\\nindustrial are buildings built after 2000, with 32’ or greater clear height and ESFR sprinklers.\\nSurvey Criteria\\nIncludes all industrial buildings 30,000 sq. ft. and greater in size in Milwaukee counties. Buildings which have begun construction as\\nevidenced by site excavation or foundation work.\\n*CBRE has updated the criteria for industrial tracked building sets to reflect buildings with a Net Rentable Area (NRA) of 30,000\\nContacts\\nsquare feet or higher. In addition to creating regional consistency, this change will enhance the reporting and depth of data on\\neach market\\'s most competitive buildings. Historical stats have been revised to reflect current industrial thresholds. Building\\ninventories will be evaluated quarterly to ensure they remain the most comprehensive and accurate representation of each\\nmarket.\\nContacts\\nMadeline Strehlow Marissa Oberlander\\nSenior Field Research Analyst Research Director\\n+1 414 274 1680 +1 312 540 4686\\nmadeline.strehlow@cbre.com marissa.oberlander@cbre.com\\n©© 22002245 CCBBRREE,, IInncc..

Ft.: Space in a building, ready for occupancy within six months; can be occupied or vacant.\\n• Availability Rate: Total Available Sq. Ft. divided by the total building Area.\\n• Average Asking Lease Rate: A calculated average that includes net and gross lease rate, weighted by their corresponding\\navailable square footage.\\n• Building Area: The total floor area sq. ft. of the building, typically taken at the “drip line” of the building.\\n• Gross Activity: All sale and lease transactions completed within a specified time period. Excludes investment sale transactions.\\n• Gross Lease Rate: Rent typically includes real property taxes, building insurance, and major maintenance.\\n• Net Absorption: The change in Occupied Sq. Ft. from one period to the next.\\n• Net Lease Rate: Rent excludes one or more of the ”net” costs (real property taxes, building insurance, and major maintenance)\\ntypically included in a Gross Lease Rate.\\n• Net-Blended Rate: A calculated average of the warehouse asking rate blended with the office asking rate\\n• Occupied Sq. Ft.: Building Area not considered vacant.\\n• Vacancy Rate: Total Vacant Sq. Ft. divided by the total Building Area.\\n• Vacant Sq. Ft.: Space that can be occupied within 30 days.\\n• Class A industrial are buildings built after 2000, with 32’ or greater clear height and ESFR sprinklers.\\nSurvey Criteria\\nCBRE has updated the criteria for industrial tracked building sets to reflect buildings with a Net Rentable Area (NRA) of 30,000\\nsquare feet or higher. In addition to creating regional consistency, this change will enhance the reporting and depth of data on\\neach market\\'s most competitive buildings. Historical stats have been revised to reflect current industrial thresholds. Building\\ninventories will be evaluated quarterly to ensure they remain the most comprehensive and accurate representation of each market.\\nContacts\\nAbigail Knop Maggie Parra\\nResearch Analyst Research Manager\\nCBRE | Minneapolis/St. Paul CBRE | North Midwest\\nabigail.knop@cbre.com maggie.parra@cbre.com\\n© 2025 CBRE, Inc.

Consequently, CBRE\\nhas revised its GDP growth outlook for this year down to just below 2%.\\nDespite policy uncertainty, credit markets are more accommodative, with tighter spreads and more\\nissuance compared to a few quarters ago. More fluid credit markets have yet to translate into stronger sales\\nvolume, as many institutional owners and reams of dry powder capital remain on the sidelines. The\\ncontinuation of accretive credit trends and eventual deployment of dry powder will depend on the impact\\nof new policies. Should they prove more inflationary, this would erode recent capital markets progress. If\\nnot, and macro impacts are limited, this could give the Fed a green light for further cuts and help unlock\\nmonies waiting on the sidelines.\\nContacts\\nErik Rodriguez Marc L.

The reality of material trade conflicts this year is now paired with realized softer economic data.\\nSome of this could be due to firms taking a ‘wait-and-see’ approach as they digest changing trade policy.\\nConsumer sentiment has declined noticeably, albeit much more than actual spending. Consequently, CBRE\\nhas revised its GDP growth outlook for this year down to just below 2%.\\nDespite policy uncertainty, credit markets are more accommodative, with tighter spreads and more\\nissuance compared to a few quarters ago. More fluid credit markets have yet to translate into stronger sales\\nvolume, as many institutional owners and reams of dry powder capital remain on the sidelines. The\\ncontinuation of accretive credit trends and eventual deployment of dry powder will depend on the impact\\nof new policies. Should they prove more inflationary, this would erode recent capital markets progress. If\\nnot, and macro impacts are limited, this could give the Fed a green light for further cuts and help unlock\\nmonies waiting on the sidelines.\\nContacts\\nErik Rodriguez Marc L.
